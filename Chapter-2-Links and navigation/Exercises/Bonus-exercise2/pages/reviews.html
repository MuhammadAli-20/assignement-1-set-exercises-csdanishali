    <h3>Annette Cizmo</h3>
    <p>Amazing movie, Millie plays the part of the young princess so well. This is a must watch. The thing I love about this movie is that they have
    an actual plot and many plot twists unlike many new movies they don't over do the CGI which was something that made the new Aquaman a little less enjoyable for me. 
    Another thing that was great was that they weren't forcing diversity and inclusion like Disney was in their last movie. 
    They made it flow without having to have this sense of forced positions and forced perspectives which was great. 
    Best movie of the year so far! Can't wait for Dune 2 & hopefully a successful sequel!</p>

    <h3>Vivienne Campbell</h3>

    <p>My husband and I loved this movie, and we are very picky. The acting and storyline really drew me into the characters emotions
    and I felt like I was there with Elodie when she was trying to escape the dragon. Apparently it has mixed reviews on rotten tomatoes, but that review site in my opinion
    is full of snobbish critics who refuse to be pleased by anything. Hope they make a second movie!</p>

    <h3>Trey Johnson</h3>

    <p>WHEN I SAY RUN, DON'T WALK TO NETFLIX AND GO WATCH THIS MOVIE...... If you have been looking for something original, something new and medieval times in dragons is up your alley then you need to go watch this movie. 
    Millie Bobby Brown gave nothing but 100% on this movie. This is by far one of the best movies we've gotten in a long time. This is coming from a movie fanatic watch this movie. Enjoy this movie. Love this movie cuz trust me you will ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°</p>
