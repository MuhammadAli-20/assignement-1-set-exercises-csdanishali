     <h2>Method of making beef nihari step by step:</h2>
     <ol> 
        <li>Put a frying pan on top of the medium heat. Add all the spices to be ground in the pan.</li>
        <li>Stir all these spices together for about 2-3 minutes. Make sure they don't get burnt!</li>
        <li>As soon as the spices get toasted, remove them from the frying pan and wait until they cool.</li>
        <li>Now add the toasted spices inside the spice grinder in order to make a refined powder.</li>
        <li>This dish only requires 1½ tablespoons of the ground spice powder. Keep the rest of the powder in an airtight container.</li>
        <li>Heat cooking oil or ghee in a normal-sized pan.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add ginger-garlic paste with sliced onions and cook them until they turn golden brown. After that, put them in the cooking pot.</li>
        <li>Put marrow bones and beef pieces into the cooking pot.</li>
        <li>Cook them on medium-high heat. Keep cooking them unless they turn brown.</li>
        <li>Now add the red chilli powder, ground spices, salt, and turmeric into the cooking pot.</li>
        <li>Mix the added ingredients in such a way that the marrow bones and beef pieces are entirely coated with the spices in the cooking pot.</li>
        <li>Next, pour adequate hot water into the cooking pot so that the water thoroughly covers the meat.</li>
        <li>Start heating the pot until the water inside begins to boil.</li>
        <li>Once the water begins to boil, immediately lower the heat of the stove.</li>
        <li>Afterwards cover the pot and let the beef nihari cook properly until the beef becomes tender.</li>
        <li>Take a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Put water and flour into it and stir well.</li>
        <li>Keep stirring until the mixture becomes slurry.</li>
        <li>Next, add the slurry mixture into the simmering nihari and stir it continuously.</li>
        <li>Cook everything together.</li>
        <li>Turn off the stove as soon as the gravy becomes thick.</li>
        <li>Enjoy the beef nihari with rice or roti.</li>
